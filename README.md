# LicensePlateRecognition
Uses python machine learning libraries to automatically recognize digits of license plate

## Neural Networks
This solution utilizes neural network libraries Keras and Sci-Kit Learn.  Keras is faster to train and more accurate, but Sci-Kit Learn is easier to implement and is more stable on different computers.
Both solutions give very good accuracy above 98%
